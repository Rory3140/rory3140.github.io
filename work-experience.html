                At college I also have another on-campus job as a student tutor for
                the Advanced Programming and Intro to Java classes in the computer
                science department after being recommended for the job by my professors.

            <p>
                I worked with various clients and customers in an office
                environment where I was conducting marketing/research surveys and
                promoting a variety of products to new and existing clients.
                Through this experience, I was able to refine my sales techniques
                and customer service skills while also gaining a deeper
                understanding of the marketing strategies and business practices
                required to succeed in a competitive market.
