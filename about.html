            <p>
                I am an enthusiastic, outgoing, and positive person with an eagerness to learn and
                embrace new challenges. I have had a passion for computers and technology for as long
                as I can remember - since learning Java eight years ago I have been captivated by the
                sense of creative freedom and the opportunity for critical thinking that Development
                and Coding provides. This has driven me to not only pursue a career in this field but
                also to teach myself various essential languages, expanding my understanding and
                knowledge.<br>

                <br>While coding is my true passion, I am far from a typical Computer Science student.
                I am also an avid rugby player, having represented my country with Ireland U19 and
                currently playing for both my university at Division 1 level and the New York Major
                League Rugby Academy. My experience in rugby has taught me invaluable lessons in teamwork,
                perseverance, and leadership, all of which I bring to the table when working with others
                on coding projects.
